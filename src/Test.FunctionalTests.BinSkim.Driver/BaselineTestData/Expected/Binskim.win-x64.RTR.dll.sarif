The stack protector (/GS) is a security feature of the compiler which makes it more difficult to exploit stack buffer overflow memory corruption vulnerabilities.\r\nThe stack protector relies on a random number, called the \"security cookie\", to detect these buffer overflows. This 'cookie' is statically linked with your binary from a Visual C++ library in the form of the symbol __security_cookie.\r\nOn recent Windows versions, the loader looks for the magic statically linked value of this cookie, and initializes the cookie with a far better source of entropy -- the system's secure random number generator -- rather than the limited random number generator available early in the C runtime startup code.\r\nWhen this symbol is not the default value, the additional entropy is not injected by the operating system, reducing the effectiveness of the stack protector.\r\nTo resolve this issue, ensure that your code does not reference or create a symbol named __security_cookie or __security_cookie_complement.\r\nNOTE: the modified cookie value detected was: {1}"
