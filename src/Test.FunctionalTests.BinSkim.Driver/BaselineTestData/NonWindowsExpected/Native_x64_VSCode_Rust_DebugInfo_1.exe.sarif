This 'cookie' is statically linked with your binary from a Visual C++ library in the form of the symbol __security_cookie. On recent Windows versions, the loader looks for the statically linked value of this cookie, and initializes the cookie with a far better source of entropy -- the system's secure random number generator -- rather than the limited random number generator available early in the C runtime startup code. When this symbol is not the default value, the additional entropy is not injected by the operating system, reducing the effectiveness of the stack protector.
