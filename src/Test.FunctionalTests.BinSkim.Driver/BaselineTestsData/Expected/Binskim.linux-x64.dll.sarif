For example, look for uses of /SECTION on the linker command line for C and C++ programs, or #pragma section in C and C++ source code, which mark a section with both attributes. Enabling incremental linking via the /INCREMENTAL argument (the default for Microsoft Visual Studio debug build) can also result in a writable and executable section named 'textbss'. For this case, disable incremental linking (or analyze an alternate build configuration that disables this feature) to resolve the problem."
