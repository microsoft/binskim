    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>'{0}' is a 64-bit image with a preferred base address below the 4GB boundary. Having a preferred base address below this boundary triggers a compatibility mode in Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) on recent versions of Windows that reduces the number of locations to which ASLR may relocate the binary. This reduces the effectiveness of ASLR at mitigating memory corruption vulnerabilities. To resolve this issue, either use the default preferred base address by removing any uses of /baseaddress from compiler command lines, or /BASE from linker command lines (recommended), or configure your program to start at a base address above 4GB when compiled for 64 bit platforms (by changing the constant passed to /baseaddress or /BASE).

  <data name="BA2008_EnableControlFlowGuard_Description" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Binaries should enable the compiler control guard feature (CFG) at build time to prevent attackers from redirecting execution to unexpected, unsafe locations. CFG analyzes and discovers all indirect-call instructions at compilation and link time. It also injects a check that precedes every indirect call in code that ensures the target is an expected, safe location.  If that check fails at runtime, the operating system will close the program.</value>

To resolve this issue, ensure that your program does not mark the imports section executable.

The NXCompat bit, also known as "Data Execution Prevention" (DEP) or "Execute Disable" (XD), is a processor feature that allows a program to mark a piece of memory as non-executable.

    <value>Code or data sections should not be marked as both shared and writable.
