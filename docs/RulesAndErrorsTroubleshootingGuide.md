# Rules and Errors Troubleshooting Guide

## ERR997.ExceptionLoadingPdb

*Example message*:

     error ERR997.ExceptionLoadingPdb : BA2002 : 'test.exe' was not evaluated for check 'DoNotIncorporateVulnerableDependencies' because its PDB could not be loaded.(E_PDB_NO_DEBUG_INFO)

Several BinSkim checks (documented in the [User Guide]()) require PDBs in order to perform analysis. If a PDB can't be loaded or if PDB information has been stripped or simply not emitted, BinSkim will raise an `ERR997.ExceptionLoadingPdb` message. The error message will include an HRESULT value describing the failure (as in the example above). The two most common error conditions are `E_PDB_NOT_FOUND` and `E_PDB_NO_DEBUGINFO`.

### Resolving `E_PDB_NO_DEBUG_INFO`

The MSVC linker [\DEBUG](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/debug-generate-debug-info?view=vs-2019) command is used to configure PDB production. To set this linker option in the Visual Studio development environment:

1. Right-click the project and select `Properties` or hit `ALT-ENTER`.
2. Expand the `Linker` folder.
3. Click the `Debugging` property page.
4. Modify the `Generate Debug Info` property.

### Resolving `E_PDB_NOT_FOUND`

By default, BinSkim will only look for a PDB alongside the binary under analysis. If a build persists PDBs to an alternate location, this path must be specified b using the `--local-symbol-directories` argument (which accepts a semicolon-delimted list of local paths containing PDBs). The `--sympath` argument must be used to configure retrieving symbols from a remote symbol server. This is typically required when analyzing 3rd party dependencies in a project, such as binaries from a NuGet package.

**NOTE:** Team's that utilize 3rd-party components assume the security risk of those dependencies. It is therefore important to acquired PDBs for any 3rd party code that is included in a production system.

#### Troubleshooting steps

1. **If a binary is compiled by your build process**: ensure that the build is producing a PDB for the file. The PDB must be persisted to the same location as the scanned binary (or a path to the PDB location must be included in the `--local-symbol-directories` argument).
2. **If the PDB is associated with an external dependency**: add or review your `--sympath` argument to ensure it references all required symbol servers. See the [User Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/binskim/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md) for mor information on this or other command-line arguments. It is important to performance and reliability reasons that your `--sympath` argument include a `CACHE*` argument that points to a writable local cache.
3. **Enable tracing**: you can enable the `--trace PdbLoad` argument as of BinSkim version 1.7.0 in order to capture BinSkim's PDB path probing logic. When enabled, BinSkim will show every file path that's examine in order to locate a PDB.
4. **Rerun analysis**: Retrieving a PDB from a symbol server is an inherently unreliable operation, as the server may not be available or may simply fail a specific request. If your PDB failures are for 3rd party PDBs retrieved from a symbol and are intermittent, this may be the problem.

## BA2024.EnableSpectreMitigations

*Example message*:

    warning BA2024: 'test.dll' was compiled with one or more modules that do not enable code generation mitigations for speculative execution side-channel attack (Spectre) vulnerabilities.

### Resolving BA2024 warning for C/C++ static libraries

Developers assume the security risk of static libraries that are linked into their binaries (because vulnerabilities in these dependencies may be exploitable once linked into other binaries).

BA2024.EnableSpectreMitigations may fire against Microsoft default C++ static libraries, such as `LibCMT.lib`. In order to resolve these warnings, the developer must install and link to the appropriate MSVC Spectre-mitigated C++ runtime libraries. To do so:

1. Launch the `Visual Studio Installer`.

2. Click `Modify` for the version of Visual Studio in use.

3. Select the `Individual Components` tab and type `spectre` in the search field.

4. Select and install Spectre-mitigated libs for your target platform.

If the error persists:
1. Stay up to date with Visual Studio version (use at least Visual Studio 2019).
2. Use release builds instead of debug builds. Some libraries are only compiled with spectre mitigation for release builds.
